<h1 align='center'>Soil Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering</h1>

## Overview
This project applies **K-Means clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning technique, to **segment soils** based on their physical, chemical, and environmental features. By identifying clusters of similar soil types, this project supports **precision agriculture, land management, and soil research**.

The main goal is to uncover patterns in soil characteristics and provide actionable insights for farmers, agronomists, and environmental scientists.

## Features
- Segmentation of soil samples into meaningful clusters
- Visualization of soil clusters in 2D and 3D spaces
- Determination of optimal number of clusters using **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**
- Scalable pipeline for clustering new soil datasets
- Integration-ready for geospatial or agricultural applications

## Methodology
The project follows a structured workflow:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather soil samples with features like pH, moisture, organic matter, texture, and mineral composition

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values using median or mode imputation
   - Scale/normalize numerical features
   - Encode categorical features if necessary

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize feature distributions and correlations
   - Identify patterns and anomalies in soil data

4. **Dimensionality Reduction (Optional)**
   - Apply **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** to reduce dimensions for visualization
   - Plot reduced dimensions to understand clustering behavior

5. **Clustering with K-Means**
   - Apply K-Means algorithm to group soil samples
   - Determine optimal clusters using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score
   - Assign cluster labels to each soil sample

6. **Visualization & Interpretation**
   - 2D and 3D cluster plots
   - Cluster centroids visualization
   - Insights on soil types and their distributions
